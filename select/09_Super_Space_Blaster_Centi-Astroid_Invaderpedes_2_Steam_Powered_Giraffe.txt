Hatchworth, look up! It's a whale! It's a whale in space!
Hatchworth, Hatchworth, look!

Hmm? Huh?
Oh, hey, cool

Uh, look, I'm really tired, I don't even know how
But uh, we've got a lot of light years until our destination
So I'm gonna go and try sleeping for the first time

A little shut-eye

Aw, she's beautiful!

(I'm just gonna back out of this...)

Oh my gosh, there's a little one
There's a little one, look, a baby!
Aw, it's like a whale cub
Oh my...

This gives me an idea for a song
Let's see, let's just grab the accordion here...

You're such a whale
You're a big, big whale
No, that's not good...
Whaley in the sky, you are so high

Oh my, oh my
There's a whole flock of them
There, there, there, there's like a dozen, like ten dozen
A whole school of space whales

Well, uh, actually, Rabbit, a group of whales is known as a pod
So they're a pod of whales

Yeah, Spine, Spine, look up
They're right above us, look up!

Yeah, sorry, Rabbit, I'm a little busy right now
I can't take my focus off what I'm currently doing
I'm trying to beat my high score of Super Space Blaster
Centi-Asteroid Invaderpedes 2
So yeah, I can't look up
Ugh, come on, come on, level 50

Golly

(You can do this!)

You guys sure, sure are a majestic bunch, aren't ya?

(Oh, I'm out of lives, w-w-wait, I just got another one, ah ha ha)

So beautiful

(I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna do it, wait, wait, wait, hold on)
